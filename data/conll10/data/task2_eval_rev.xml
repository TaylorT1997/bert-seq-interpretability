					<sentence id="S1.13">It is well-established that the innate immune response leads to activation of adaptive immunity, shaping the proper response, depending upon the pathogen eliciting the reaction.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.14">Conversely, though, it is also clear that adaptive immune response, especially, CD4+ or helper T cells orchestrate responses to effectively eliminate pathogens.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.15">Classically, helper T cells were considered to differentiate into two lineages, T helper 1 (Th1) cells or Th2 cells (1).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.16">In addition to ligation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory receptors, a suitable cytokine milieu is required for fate decision of helper T cells (1).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.17">In particular, interleukin-12 (IL-12), which is produced by activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), promotes Th1 differentiation (2), whereas IL-4, produced by activated T cells and some innate immune cells, drives Th2 differentiation (1).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.18">While the Th1/Th2 paradigm provided invaluable insights for immunologists, its limitations were also clear.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.19">What was the most obvious was the inability of this dichotomy to explain autoimmune diseases.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.20">More recent studies have shown the existence of the additional subpopulations of T helper cells that are also important in immunoregulation and host defense.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.21">One important subset is CD4+CD25+, regulatory T cells (Tregs) (3, 4).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.22">Tregs suppress the proliferation and function of effector T cells, and attenuate immune responses against self or nonself-antigens (3, 4).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.23">Another recently identified new fate of T cells is Th17 cells that selectively produce IL-17 (A and F) (5, 6).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.24">In the past three years, discoveries pertaining to this newly identified T helper subset in humans and mice have accumulated with tremendous speed (7-10).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S1.50">Accordingly, additional studies on IL-23p19-deficient mice and the anti-IL-23p19 antibody revealed that IL-23, but not IL-12, was the culprit in autoimmunity, at least in mouse disease models (21-23).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S1.51">The pathogenic role of IL-23 was also confirmed by the phenotype of IL-23p19 transgenic mice, in which premature death, systemic inflammation, anemia, and elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins were observed (22).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S1.66">Regardless of exactly how IL-23 works, these reports supported the idea that an IL-23/IL-17 axis, but not IL-12/IFN-γ axis, was a crucial pathway in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases (21, 30).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S3.220">We show that constitutive coactivation of EGFR-Ras and PI3K signaling in Drosophila glia and glial precursors gives rise to neoplastic, invasive cells that create transplantable tumor-like growths, mimicking human glioma, and mirroring mouse glioma models.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S3.222">This was not necessarily an expected result since fly and human glia show many biological differences despite displaying important similarities [9],[55],[56].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.223">Through genetic analysis of our model, we identified crucial downstream effectors of EGFR and PI3K signaling, many of which are mutated and/or activated in human glioma.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.224">These effectors act in a combinatorial network to coordinately stimulate cell cycle entry and progression, block cell cycle exit, and promote inappropriate cellular growth and migration (Figure 8J).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.225">Pathways within this network, while interdependent, act synergistically, rather than additively.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.226">Thus, Drosophila shows evolutionary conservation of oncogene cooperation.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.227">At least four pathway circuits are necessary for glial neoplasia initiated by EGFR and PI3K signaling, including dRas and dMyc circuits, which induce dCyclinE and dCyclinD to drive cell cycle entry, a Pnt circuit, which induces Stg to promote cell cycle progression, and a Tor-eIF4E-S6K pathway, which provides protein translation necessary for proliferation and growth (Figure 8J).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S3.228">When activated individually, these pathways fail to elicit glial neoplasia, <xcope id="X3.228.1"><cue ref="X3.228.1" type="speculation">implying</cue> a requirement for coordinated stimulation of multiple effectors and inactivation of negative regulators</xcope>.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S4.11">Mitosis, the process by which identical copies of the replicated genome are distributed to the products of each cell division, involves a highly dynamic sequence of coordinated motility events, mediated by a bipolar protein machine, the mitotic spindle (Karsenti and Vernos, 2001 ; Mitchison and Salmon, 2001 ; Gadde and Heald, 2004 ; Wadsworth and Khodjakov, 2004 ; Mogilner et al., 2006 ; Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2007 ; Walczak and Heald, 2008 ).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S4.12">These motility events are driven by molecular-scale forces generated by mitotic kinesins and dyneins, together with dynamic microtubules (MTs), whose activities are controlled by a network of regulatory proteins, e.g., mitotic kinases, phosphatases, and proteolytic enzymes (Sharp et al., 2000c ; Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2004 ; Maiato and Sunkel, 2004 ; Rogers et al., 2005 ; Goshima et al., 2007 ).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S4.16">These results <xcope id="X4.16.2"><cue ref="X4.16.2" type="speculation">suggest</cue> that ensembles of multiple kinesin-5 motors <xcope id="X4.16.1"><cue ref="X4.16.1" type="speculation">could</cue> serve as dynamic cross-links that organize spindle MTs into bundles and drive a sliding filament mechanism that pushes apart antiparallel spindle MTs</xcope></xcope> (Sharp et al., 1999a ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ), although alternative mechanisms of action for kinesin-5 motors have also been proposed (Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001 ; Tsai et al., 2006 ; Johansen and Johansen, 2007 ; Gardner et al., 2008 ).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S5.119">We <xcope id="X5.119.4"><cue ref="X5.119.4" type="speculation">hypothesized</cue> that <xcope id="X5.119.3">the balance of inflammatory to regulatory immune responses <cue ref="X5.119.3" type="speculation">would</cue> be biased towards a more inflammatory response in children with severe malaria than in children with uncomplicated malaria</xcope>, that <xcope id="X5.119.2">this balance <cue ref="X5.119.2" type="speculation">would</cue> be restored during convalescence</xcope> and – crucially – that <xcope id="X5.119.1">this <cue ref="X5.119.1" type="speculation">would</cue> be associated with differences in the proportion, absolute number or function of circulating classical (CD4+ CD127-/lo FOXP3+) regulatory T cells</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.120">In partial support of these hypotheses, the number of cells expressing a Treg phenotype and FOXP3-mRNA levels were both significantly higher during convalescence than during the acute clinical episode and the ratio of the Th1 transcription factor T-BET to the Treg transcription factor FOXP3 was significantly higher during acute disease than during convalescence in both severe and uncomplicated cases, compatible with the notion that Tregs fail to sufficiently regulate pro-inflammatory responses which might contribute to the onset of symptomatic malaria infection.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.121">Given our previous observation of Treg expansion during the pre-patent phase of malaria infection [27], we <xcope id="X5.121.1"><cue ref="X5.121.1" type="speculation">suggest</cue> that Tregs are induced/activated shortly after parasite emergence from the liver, that their numbers in peripheral blood then decline as a result of sequestration of CD4+ T cells during acute disease [40],[41],[56] and then, as has been described for other T cell subsets [39],[57], Tregs regain access to the circulation after malaria is cured</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.122">The significant positive correlation of Treg numbers with parasitaemia, as well as the correlation between FOXP3 mRNA and IFN-γ mRNA levels in acute samples, further supports the notion that the initial infection induces a proportional increase in Tregs, attempting to balance the effector T cell response, and is in line with the recently proposed concept that antigenic challenge will give rise to an antigen specific Treg response, proportional in size to the inflammatory response [58].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.123">Moreover, the Tregs circulating during acute malaria infections almost exclusively expressed an activated memory phenotype <xcope id="X5.123.1"><cue ref="X5.123.1" type="speculation">suggesting</cue> that they have expanded from a pre-existing pool of memory T-cells</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.124">This interpretation <xcope id="X5.124.1"><cue ref="X5.124.1" type="speculation">would</cue> be in line with recent elegant work in humans demonstrating that Tregs are derived by rapid turnover of memory populations in vivo [59], and with data from murine studies where, after CD25-depletion, malaria infection very rapidly drives differentiation of Tregs from circulating mature CD4+ T cells</xcope> [60].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.125">Obviously, it <xcope id="X5.125.1"><cue ref="X5.125.1" type="speculation">would</cue> be of interest to study the relationship between Tregs and effector T cell kinetics and parasite biomass, which is not readily measurable</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.126">Future studies <xcope id="X5.126.2"><cue ref="X5.126.2" type="speculation">may</cue> explore the usefulness of P. falciparum Histidine Rich Protein 2 in this context, <xcope id="X5.126.1">which has recently been <cue ref="X5.126.1" type="speculation">suggested</cue> as a surrogate marker for parasite biomass</xcope></xcope> [61].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.127">However, despite clear evidence of Treg induction and reallocation during acute malaria infection, we could not find any robust differences in Treg parameters between children with severe and uncomplicated disease.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.128">Thus, neither Treg numbers nor FOXP3 mRNA levels differed significantly between children with uncomplicated malaria and those with severe malaria, and three different indicators of Treg function - their capacity to suppress lymphoproliferation, their expression of SOCS-2 [45] and TNFR2 [46],[48] were all similar in severely ill children and children with uncomplicated disease.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.129">Furthermore, the similar distortion in the T-BET/FOXP3 mRNA ratio during acute disease and the lack of any marked differences between the two groups in ratios of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the close correlation between IFN-γ and IL-10 in both groups which is in line with previous observations in experimental human malaria infections [62], <xcope id="X5.129.1"><cue ref="X5.129.1" type="speculation">suggests</cue> that the systemic shift towards a pro-inflammatory immune response is similar in children with either severe or uncomplicated disease</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.130">At first glance, <xcope id="X5.130.2">these data do not <cue ref="X5.130.2" type="speculation">appear</cue> to support the <xcope id="X5.130.1"><cue ref="X5.130.1" type="speculation">hypothesis</cue> that deficiencies in Treg function underlie the tendency of some children to develop severe, life threatening malaria</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.131">However, we did observe significantly higher Th1 effector responses (more T-effector cells, higher concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α) in severely ill children than in children with uncomplicated disease, <xcope id="X5.131.2"><cue ref="X5.131.2" type="speculation">suggesting</cue> that the classical FOXP3+ Treg response that develops during acute malaria infection <xcope id="X5.131.1"><cue ref="X5.131.1" type="speculation">may</cue> be insufficient to balance the florid effector T cell response that develops particularly in children with severe disease</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.132">This <xcope id="X5.132.1"><cue ref="X5.132.1" type="speculation">would</cue> be in line with evidence showing that as the strength of the inflammatory stimulus increases, the suppressive capacity of human Tregs declines and the resistance of T-effector cells to regulation increases</xcope> [63].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.133">The situation observed during an acute, clinical malaria infection is thus in clear contrast to the situation in healthy, malaria-exposed individuals where Treg numbers closely track numbers of T-effectors, precisely maintaining an apparently optimal T-effectorTreg ratio [36].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.134">IL-10 is well-established as a vital homeostatic regulator of malaria-induced inflammation that prevents immune-pathology in mice [49],[64], promotes the necessary switch from early Th1 to subsequent Th2 responses [65],[66], and has been linked to protection from severe malaria anaemia [24],[25], and death [23] in humans.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.135">However, the cellular source of IL-10 in human malaria cases was, until now, ill defined.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.136">Contrary to our expectations, but in striking agreement with observations in P. yoelii-infected mice [33], CD45RO+ CD4+ T cells (that are CD25- and FOXP3-) and not classical Tregs are the only substantial source of IL-10 during acute malaria infection.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.137">This observation is reminiscent of that made by Nylen [67] in patients with acute visceral leishmaniasis.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.138">Moreover, in our patients, a significant proportion of IL-10 producing CD4+ T cells were simultaneously producing IFN-γ, identifying them as Th1 cells.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.139">Although IL-10 secreting Th1 cells have been described recently in two murine models of toxoplasmosis [50], and cutaneous leishmaniasis [51], as far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration of IL-10 producing Th1 cells during human infections.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.140">Intriguingly, the proportion of these cells within the total CD4+ T cell population was significantly higher in children with uncomplicated malaria than in children with severe malaria <xcope id="X5.140.2"><cue ref="X5.140.2" type="speculation">suggesting</cue> that in human P. falciparum infection, as in murine T.gondii infections [50], IL-10 producing Th1 cells, activated by a strong inflammatory stimulus, <xcope id="X5.140.1"><cue ref="X5.140.1" type="speculation">may</cue> act as anti-parasitic effector cells with a “built in” control mechanism to prevent the onset of immune pathology</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.141">If so, then the ability of these self-regulating effector cells to localize to sites of parasite sequestration in tissues, where they mediate parasite killing whilst simultaneously blocking tissue damage, <xcope id="X5.141.1"><cue ref="X5.141.1" type="speculation">may</cue> be key to clinical immunity to malaria</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.142">Thus, our data strongly <xcope id="X5.142.2"><cue ref="X5.142.2" type="speculation">suggest</cue> that the percentage of IL-10-producing Th1 effector cells, rather than the cocktail of circulating cytokines, <xcope id="X5.142.1"><cue ref="X5.142.1" type="speculation">may</cue> be the most relevant biomarker of effective immunity to severe malaria</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.143">Although <xcope id="X5.143.1">(Tregs <cue ref="X5.143.1" type="speculation">may</cue> not <cue ref="X5.143.1" type="speculation">seem</cue> to determine the outcome of current P. falciparum infections</xcope>) we did find evidence that they affect the magnitude of the malaria specific memory response induced by the current infection.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.144">A similar observation has been made in P. berghei ANKA-infected mice; animals that were depleted of CD25+ cells prior to infection and drug-cured on day 5 developed significantly stronger IFN-γ memory responses on day 14 than did intact infected/cured mice, and these mice also developed much more severe, and frequently fatal, clinical symptoms upon reinfection, despite more efficient parasite clearance [35].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.145">Thus, malaria specific Tregs acquired during a primary infection <xcope id="X5.145.1"><cue ref="X5.145.1" type="speculation">may</cue> limit the magnitude of Th1 effector responses to subsequent infections to a level that allows parasite clearance without causing immunopathology</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.146">Future studies should be designed to test the <xcope id="X5.146.2"><cue ref="X5.146.2" type="speculation">hypothesis</cue> that Tregs <xcope id="X5.146.1"><cue ref="X5.146.1" type="speculation">may</cue> contribute to the very rapid development of resistance to severe malaria</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.147">In summary, our data <xcope id="X5.147.1"><cue ref="X5.147.1" type="speculation">indicate that</cue> classical FOXP3+ Tregs are unable to control the florid inflammation that accompanies acute malaria infections and this component of the immunoregulatory arsenal is rapidly overwhelmed in children with either mild or severe malaria</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.148">Importantly however we have identified, for the first time in an acute human infection, a population of IL-10 producing Th1 effector cells <xcope id="X5.148.1">which <cue ref="X5.148.1" type="speculation">appear</cue> to be a major source of this key anti-inflammatory cytokine during acute malaria infection</xcope>, and which are associated with development of uncomplicated as opposed to severe malaria.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S5.149">We <xcope id="X5.149.3"><cue ref="X5.149.3" type="speculation">propose</cue> that IL-10-producing Th1 cells <xcope id="X5.149.2"><cue ref="X5.149.2" type="speculation">may</cue> be the essential regulators of acute infection-induced inflammation</xcope> and that such “self-regulating” Th1 cells <xcope id="X5.149.1"><cue ref="X5.149.1" type="speculation">may</cue> be essential for the infection to be cleared without inducing immune-mediated pathology</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S6.11">Among the most commonly identified rearrangements are the t(8;21)(q22;q22) in 12% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the t(12;21)(p13;q22) in 25% of pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), both of which involve the RUNX1 gene.3</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.12">The molecular consequence of these translocations is the generation of fusion proteins, AML1-ETO and TEL-AML1, respectively.4–7</sentence>

					<sentence id="S6.19">The eTAFH (or NHR1) domain interacts with the nuclear hormone receptor corepressor (N-CoR),13 and also with the activation domain of E proteins (E2A and HEB).14</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.20">The HHR (NHR2) domain forms an α-helical tetramer that mediates oligomerization of AML1-ETO with itself and other ETO proteins and interacts with the corepressor Sin3, Gfi1, and histone deacetylases 1 and 3.12,15–20</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.21">Nervy (NHR3) is an α-helical domain that interacts with the regulatory subunit of type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. 21,22</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.22">Myeloid-Nervy-DEAF-1 (MYND or NHR4) is a zinc-chelating domain structurally homologous to the PHD and RING finger domains and mediates interactions with N-CoR, the silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT), and the DNA binding protein SON. 16,23–26</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.23">A foreshortened splice variant of AML1-ETO lacking both the Nervy and MYND domains (AML1-ETO9a), or full-length AML1-ETO with a mutation predicted to disrupt the structure of the MYND domain and shown to impair SON binding had increased leukemogenic potential.23,27,28</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.24">The Runt domain from Runx1 mediates both DNA binding and heterodimerization with CBFß.29</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.25">Both of these properties are essential for normal Runx1 function in vivo.30</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.26">CBFß enhances the affinity of the Runt domain for DNA by 7- to 10-fold through quenching conformational exchange in several dynamic regions 31–36 and <xcope id="X6.26.1"><cue ref="X6.26.1" type="speculation">may</cue> additionally inhibit Runx1 degradation mediated by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway</xcope>.37</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.27">An R174Q mutation in Runx1 found in AML of the M0 subtype and in familial platelet disorder with predisposition for AML (FPD/AML) that disrupts only DNA but not CBFß binding generated a weakly dominant negative Runx1 allele.30,38–40</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.28">Single amino acid substitutions in Runx1 that impaired CBFß but not DNA binding resulted in hypomorphic alleles that diminished but did not eliminate Runx1's in vivo activity.30</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.29">The most commonly accepted models of AML1-ETO–mediated leukemogenesis posit that it functions either as a dominant inhibitor of CBF function41–43 or as a constitutive repressor of CBF target gene expression.44</sentence>

					<sentence id="S6.32">For example, <xcope id="X6.32.3">it was <cue ref="X6.32.3" type="speculation">proposed</cue> that AML1-ETO <xcope id="X6.32.2"><cue ref="X6.32.2" type="speculation">may</cue> function by sequestering transcription factors (such as E-box proteins), SON, or other regulatory proteins into subnuclear compartments</xcope>13,23 and that its DNA binding function <xcope id="X6.32.1"><cue ref="X6.32.1" type="speculation">may</cue> not be necessary</xcope></xcope>.13</sentence>

					<sentence id="S6.37">The components of TEL retained in the fusion protein include the Pointed domain, which forms a head-to-tail polymeric structure, as well as a corepressor binding domain, which together mediate interaction with N-CoR, SMRT, and mSin3a.6,51–55</sentence>
					<sentence id="S6.38">The predominant model of TEL-AML1 function posits that it recruits corepressor complexes to CBF target genes in a Runt domain-dependent manner, resulting in inappropriate gene regulation.52,56,57</sentence>

					<sentence id="S7.15">The U3 region contains an upstream regulatory element including binding sites for several cellular transcription factors such as the nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) and the activator protein 1 (AP-1), an enhancer with two binding sites for the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and the core promoter composed of three tandem binding sites for specificity protein 1 (Sp1) and a TATA box.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.16">While NF-κB is a strong enhancer of HIV-1 transcription (8), Sp1 is essential for basal transcription and Tat-mediated activation of HIV-1 (25, 69).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.17">This is concordant with the fact that Sp1 is upregulated in activated T cells (43), which compose the primary reservoir for HIV-1 replication (68).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S7.20">The O-glycosidic linkage of GlcNAc to proteins is a highly dynamic and reversible posttranslational modification and differs from other glycosylation events in that it occurs in the cytosol and the nucleus rather than in the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.21">Protein O-linked N-acetyl-d-glucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and reversed by O-GlcNAc hexosaminidase (O-GlcNAcase) (30).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.22">The substrate for protein O-GlcNAcylation is UDP-GlcNAc.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.23">Therefore, O- GlcNAcylation is regulated by the cellular levels of OGT and O-GlcNAcase and by the availability of UDP-GlcNAc (81).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S7.347">First, we demonstrated that O- GlcNAc-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 transcription required the presence of Sp1-binding sites in the HIV-1 LTR promoter.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S7.348">The Sp1-binding sites are well conserved throughout the lentiviral HIV-1 LTRs (18), and mutation of one or more Sp1-binding sites in the basal HIV-1 LTR promoter leads to a strong delay in replication in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in T-cell lines (45, 58).</sentence>

				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S8.9">Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant, progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by deteriorating choreic movements, psychiatric disturbances and cognitive deficits (Gusella and MacDonald, 1995; Martin and Gusella, 1986; Vonsattel et al., 1985).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.10">HD is caused by an abnormal expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract at the N-terminus of a large cytoplasmic protein, huntingtin (Htt) (The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.11">The polyQ tract contains between 6 and 35 repeats in the wild-type Htt protein, whereas it is expanded to beyond 36 repeats in HD (The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.12">Numerous studies have demonstrated that mutant Htt containing an expanded polyQ tract is toxic to neurons (Cattaneo et al., 2001; Gusella and MacDonald, 2000).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.13">PolyQ expansion is also linked to at least eight other neurodegenerative disorders, collectively referred to as polyQ diseases (Riley and Orr, 2006; Zoghbi and Orr, 2000).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.14">Although Htt is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, HD mainly affects medium-sized spiny neurons in the striatum and to a lesser extent cortical pyramidal neurons that project to the striatum, <xcope id="X8.14.1"><cue ref="X8.14.1" type="speculation">suggesting</cue> that other cellular factors also contribute to pathogenesis</xcope> (Cattaneo et al., 2001; Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.15">Recent studies <xcope id="X8.15.2"><cue ref="X8.15.2" type="speculation">indicate that</cue> an alteration of wild-type Htt function <xcope id="X8.15.1"><cue ref="X8.15.1" type="speculation">might</cue> contribute to this specificity and to subsequent disease progression</xcope></xcope> (Cattaneo et al., 2001).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.16">For example, mutant Htt can sequester wild-type Htt into insoluble aggregates, thereby exerting a dominant negative effect (Huang et al., 1998; Kazantsev et al., 1999; Narain et al., 1999; Preisinger et al., 1999; Wheeler et al., 2000).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.17">In addition, wild-type Htt can suppress the cell death induced by mutant polyQ-expanded Htt in vitro (Leavitt et al., 2001; Van Raamsdonk et al., 2005).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.18">Furthermore, <xcope id="X8.18.1">wild-type Htt is <cue ref="X8.18.1" type="speculation">proposed</cue> to have a neuroprotective role</xcope> as expression of Htt can protect cultured striatal neurons from stress- and toxin-mediated cell death (Rigamonti et al., 2000).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.19">Since its identification, the normal function of Htt has been subject to extensive investigation (Cattaneo et al., 2001; Harjes and Wanker, 2003).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.20">The murine Htt homolog (also known as Hdh) is essential during early mouse development, as Htt-null mice die during gastrulation at embryonic day 7.5 (Duyao et al., 1995; Nasir et al., 1995; Zeitlin et al., 1995).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.21">Chimeric analysis demonstrated that the early embryonic lethality is the result of a crucial role of Hdh in extraembryonic membranes, as <xcope id="X8.21.1">this lethality <cue ref="X8.21.1" type="speculation">can</cue> be rescued by providing wild-type Hdh function in extraembryonic tissue</xcope> (Dragatsis et al., 1998).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S8.28">Functional studies in mammalian systems, mainly from protein interaction assays, have associated Htt with diverse cellular processes including: endocytosis; modulation of synapse structure and synaptic transmission; transcriptional regulation, especially of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is essential for the survival of the striatal neurons affected in HD; axonal transport of BDNF and vesicles; and apoptosis (Cattaneo et al., 2001; Cattaneo et al., 2005; Harjes and Wanker, 2003; Zuccato et al., 2001; Zuccato and Cattaneo, 2007).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S8.29">Importantly, only a few of these proposed functions of Htt have been directly tested in vivo owing to the early embryonic lethality associated with Htt-null mutant mice.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S12.20">Due to the rapid advances in biomedical research, scientific literature is being published at an ever-increasing rate [1].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.21">Without automated means, it is difficult for researchers to keep abreast of developments within biomedicine [2-6].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.22">Text mining, which is receiving increasing interest within the biomedical field [7,8], enriches text via the addition of semantic metadata, and thus permits tasks such as analysing molecular pathways [9] and semantic searching.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.23">Semantic searching above the level of concepts depends on prior processing to recognise relations or events in texts, which is carried out by information extraction (IE) systems.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.24">Due to domain-specific features of texts and the types of events to be recognised, IE systems must be adapted to deal with specific domains.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.25">A well-established method of carrying out this adaptation is through training using annotated corpora (e.g., [10-12]).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.26">Our work has been concerned with the development of such a corpus for the biomedical field, the Gene Regulation Event Corpus (GREC), consisting of MEDLINE abstracts semantically annotated with event information.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.27">Our approach is based on the fact that many events are focussed on either verbs (e.g., transcribe, regulate) or nominalised verbs (e.g., transcription, regulation).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.28">Both types of word behave in similar ways, in that they specify arguments that <xcope id="X12.28.1"><cue ref="X12.28.1" type="speculation">can</cue> convey a range of different types of information related to the event</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.29">For each relevant event, our annotation aims to identify, as exhaustively as possible, all structurally-related arguments within the same sentence.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.30">Each argument is assigned a semantic role from a fixed set of 13 roles.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.31">Where appropriate, arguments are also assigned a biological concept type.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S12.49">Whilst events are often identified by verbs, nominalised verbs play a particularly important role within biomedical texts, and often outnumber other domain-specific verbal forms [25].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.50">However, it is acknowledged that they are more difficult to process than verbs [26] and are currently only dealt with by a small number of systems, often in a limited way (e.g., [17,27,28]).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.51">Due to the central nature of verbs and nominalised verbs in the description of events, accurate event extraction requires information about the way they behave in text, in terms of:</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.52">• Their syntactically-related arguments, e.g. causality, location, manner, etc.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.53">• Semantic information relating to each argument (e.g., semantic roles or restrictions on the types of phrase that can constitute each argument).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.54">The production of corpora annotated with such information allows real usage within text to be taken into account.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.55">Large-scale annotation of corpora within the general language domain at this level of detail has resulted in the production of resources containing syntactic and semantic frame information, which deal with both verbs and nominalised verbs [29-32].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.56">Such annotated corpora also facilitate the training of components of IE systems, with a large amount of research having been devoted to semantic role labelling (SRL) [33].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.57">Some studies (e.g., [34,35]) have shown that, to a certain extent, general language resources <xcope id="X12.57.1"><cue ref="X12.57.1" type="speculation">can</cue> also be useful in the training of SRLs for biomedical texts</xcope>, due to the fact that many verbs appear in texts from both the general language and biomedical domains, and often behave in similar ways.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.58">However, the cited works concede that, whilst such SRLs <xcope id="X12.58.1"><cue ref="X12.58.1" type="speculation">may</cue> produce adequate results for certain predicates</xcope>, training using biomedical corpora is also needed.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.59">This is because domains such as biomedicine employ sublanguages [36], in which the "informational content and structure form a specialized language that can be delineated in the form of a sublanguage grammar".</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.60">NLP systems must take such grammars into account to allow accurate processing of text within specialist domains [37].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.61">Sublanguage grammar features that are relevant to our work include the following:</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.62">• The types of events found in biological sciences are often described using verbs/nominalised verbs that do not feature prominently in general language [26], e.g., methylate.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.63">• Verbs/nominalised verbs that occur in both the general and specialised language domains <xcope id="X12.63.1"><cue ref="X12.63.1" type="speculation">may</cue> have different syntactic and semantic properties in each domain, e.g., differing numbers of arguments [38], as well as different meanings</xcope>.</sentence>

				</DocumentPart>
				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S12.68">Existing event corpora within the domain (e.g., [21] and [23]) are not specifically geared to support the acquisition of semantic frame information for verbs.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.69">The bio-NLP community has, until now, lacked a domain-specific linguistically-oriented corpus in which detailed semantic information for a wide range of both verbs and nominalised verbs has been annotated.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.70">This has limited the amount of research undertaken on the production of domain-specific semantic frame resources and SRLs.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.71">In response to this, we have designed a new event annotation scheme which is specifically tailored to this purpose.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.72">The scheme has subsequently been applied to the annotation of event instances relating to gene regulation and expression in MEDLINE abstracts.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.73">Our scheme differs from those of previous event corpora in the field in a number of important ways:</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.74">• It captures the semantic annotation of as many structurally-related arguments as possible of a large number of verbs and nominalised verbs describing gene regulation and expression events.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.75">This is important since, according to [20], and as confirmed by us through consultation with biologists, types of information such as location, manner, timing and condition, which <xcope id="X12.75.1"><cue ref="X12.75.1" type="speculation">can</cue> appear in various syntactic positions</xcope>, are all essential for describing biomedical relations.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.76">A sentence-based approach facilitates the linking between semantic information and syntactic structure.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.77">• It bridges linguistic and biological knowledge:</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.78">From the linguistic perspective, all arguments are characterised using semantic roles.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.79">We have defined a new, closed set of event-independent roles which are designed for application to arguments of a range of types of biomedical events.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.80">Closed sets of semantic roles are advantageous in that they facilitate generalization over different types of events [25,42].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.81">Although their application to general language <xcope id="X12.81.2"><cue ref="X12.81.2" type="speculation">may</cue> be problematic</xcope> [30], the use of a closed set is viable in a restricted domain, as <xcope id="X12.81.1">domain-specific definitions <cue ref="X12.81.1" type="speculation">can</cue> be provided for each semantic role type</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.82">From the biological perspective, appropriate arguments are additionally assigned a biological concept type from a hierarchically-structured set that is tailored to the gene regulation domain.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.83">The concepts are mapped to classes in the Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO) [43].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.84">The combination of semantic role and biological concept labels provides a rich annotation, aimed at allowing users to have a large amount of flexibility over the type of query they specify and to have control over the specificity or generality of certain parts of the query, e.g.:</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.85">In LOCATION:E. coli, AGENT:NifA activates which THEME:GENE.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S12.91">This unique text mining resource for biology provides and links syntactic and semantic frame information for a large number of biomedical sublanguage verbs.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S12.390">The corpus can act as a basis for creating domain-specific semantic frame resources, and has already been used in the production of semantic frames for inclusion within the BioLexicon [44], in which the semantic frames are linked with syntactic information.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.391">It is also hoped that the corpus <xcope id="X12.391.1"><cue ref="X12.391.1" type="speculation">will</cue> boost research into other areas of bio-IE, such as the production of domain-specific SRLs, which have previously suffered due to the lack of a suitably annotated corpus</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.392">Initial experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of training an SRL using the corpus and as such, we hope to exploit the corpus in future shared tasks with such an aim.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S12.394">Evaluation of the corpus quality was carried out using a newly-devised methodology, taking into account multiple aspects of the annotation task.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.395">Average agreement rates for the various tasks fell within the range of 66% - 90% F-score.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.396">Through error analysis of the corpus, we identified the most problematic issues, which included difficulties in assigning particular semantic roles, particularly CONDITION and DESCRIPTIVE-THEME.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S12.397">A full examination of the problematic cases will allow us to further improve the guidelines and <xcope id="X12.397.1"><cue ref="X12.397.1" type="speculation">possibly</cue> impose further restrictions in the annotation software, to prevent common types of errors being made</xcope>.</sentence>

				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S13.22">In recent years it has become clear that proteins with highly modular architectures possess numerous short peptide motifs that are essential to their function [1-5].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.23">Such peptides are termed Linear Motifs (LM) as, in contrast to the globular domains, their function is independent of tertiary structure and encoded solely by the amino acid sequence.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.24">They are found in a diverse range of proteins, such as membrane receptors, adaptors, scaffolds and transcription factors, and mediate numerous tasks, which <xcope id="X13.24.1"><cue ref="X13.24.1" type="speculation">can</cue> be as disparate as directing subcellular localization or acting as sites of cleavage</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.25">Well-known LMs include peptides binding SH3, Cyclin, PDZ and WW domains [6-10] and phosphorylated peptides interacting with SH2, PTB, BRCT and FHA phosphopeptide-binding domains [11-17].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.26">The biological properties and range of functions mediated by LMs are reviewed in detail elsewhere [4,18-20].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.27">In order to deconvolute the functional components of modular protein architectures, it is necessary to identify the set of LMs as well as the folded components.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.28">However, this is not straightforward because simple searches with short sequence patterns, known to act as functional modules, are uninformative - returning a flood of false positive matches.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.29">Several tools have been developed to rank motifs based on confidence of functionality by classifying putative motifs based on the hypothesis that functional motifs will have attributes similar to experimentally discovered motifs.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.30">Although classification tools <xcope id="X13.30.2"><cue ref="X13.30.2" type="speculation">cannot definitely confirm</cue> a motif as functional</xcope> (only experimental analysis <xcope id="X13.30.1"><cue ref="X13.30.1" type="speculation">can</cue> achieve this</xcope>) they can be used to attach a level of confidence to a motif.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.31">For example <xcope id="X13.31.1">motifs which occur in an incorrect cellular compartment, or outside the known taxonomic range, are <cue ref="X13.31.1" type="speculation">unlikely</cue> to be functional as are those which are not conserved in closely related proteins or buried in a globular domain inaccessible for interaction</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.32">Available motif discovery tools vary in their implementation of confidence-related metrics.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.33">ScanProsite [21], the web-based tool for detecting PROSITE [22] signature matches in protein sequences, recently integrated ProRules [23], a database containing additional information about PROSITE profiles, with the aim of increasing the discriminatory power of PROSITE profiles to facilitate function determination and provide biologically relevant information for the annotation of proteins.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.34">MnM [24,25], a motif database and a web-based tool for identifying candidate motif occurrences in proteins, addresses the issue of non-functional false positives by implementing evolutionary conservation, surface prediction and frequency scores to rank motif occurrences in a protein query.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S13.37">DILIMOT and SLiMFinder - tools designed for discovery of candidate novel peptide patterns significantly enriched in protein interaction datasets - also use some of these techniques to improve confidence in returned motifs [29,30].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.38">Sequence conservation has also been shown to be effective in up-weighting true motifs relative to false positive matches [31-33].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.39">In the intracellular milieu, LMs are found to be particularly abundant in segments of IUP where they are readily accessible [34].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.40">Accessibility is a basic requirement of LM function which is almost always mediated by direct interaction with globular domain ligands.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.41">Extracellular proteins tend to have much less natively disordered polypeptide and therefore the extracellular linear motifs such as N-glycosylation sites [35] and the integrin-binding RGD motif [36] usually occur within globular domains, most often residing in exposed loop regions.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.42">LMs are also regularly found in globular regions of intracellular proteins - for example phosphorylation sites are common in flexible loops [37].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.43">However, close inspection of the literature also reveals many instances of candidate motifs falsely reported as functional on the basis of loss of function mutagenesis and out-of-context peptide-binding experiments, despite the motif being well structured and sometimes deeply buried in a globular domain [38-41].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.44">This observation <xcope id="X13.44.2"><cue ref="X13.44.2" type="speculation">suggests</cue> that stringent examination of motif structural context <xcope id="X13.44.1"><cue ref="X13.44.1" type="speculation">should</cue> be an essential processing step for experimental analysis</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S13.48">The MnM surface prediction score uses primary sequence based prediction both in those cases where a structure is available and in regions where a disorder predictor will render secondary structure prediction unnecessary.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.49">In the present manuscript, we address the issue of LM accessibility when the matches occur within globular domains for which a reference three-dimensional (3D) structure is available.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.50">Development and calibration of a structure filter is currently not straightforward as there are relatively few available structures for most motif classes (an obvious exception being N-glycosylation sites), placing limitations on the training and benchmarking possibilities.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S13.51">Nevertheless, we have been able to develop a protocol in which reference domain structures are selected and then the matched motifs evaluated using accessibility and secondary structure parameters.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S14.15">Background</sentence>
				</DocumentPart>
				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S14.16">Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, particularly liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization, has become the predominant technique for identification and quantification of proteins in biological systems [1].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.17">Growing demand for improved annotation of primary proteomics data with biological information from various public databases has catalyzed interest in the development of software tools to support integration of these data types.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.18">Unfortunately, a number of factors, including lack of experimental standardization, rapid introduction of novel mass spectrometry technology, and the evolution of proprietary file formats associated with proteomics platforms represent a significant hurdle to the development of efficient and comprehensive software frameworks.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.19">To accommodate the emergent nature of proteomics-related technologies and the burgeoning number of databases that contain various biological annotations, data analytic systems must emphasize (i) intuitive and interactive interfaces, (ii) user-accessible coding frameworks to facilitate rapid prototyping of algorithms, and (iii) customizable sets of tools that can be readily integrated to provide pipelines that support a variety of proteomic workflows.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.20">Task specific Windows desktop applications such as MSQuant [2] and InsilicosViewer [3] can access a subset of native mass spectrometry data files directly and provide flexibility through adjustable parameters, but are not readily extended across the full spectrum of data analytic activities required in modern proteomics research.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.21">To address the full spectrum of analyses, open source projects such as The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline (TOPP) [4] and ProteoWizard [5] offer a set of modular tools for generation of pipelines.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.22">The C++ coding environment of these tools is designed for performance and throughput, although researchers who lack programming experience often struggle to implement novel algorithms or other ad hoc tasks.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.23">Therefore, software libraries such as InSilicoSpectro [6] and mspire [7] have been developed based on high-level languages such as Perl and Ruby respectively.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.24">These libraries allow scripting of common data analysis tasks but cannot access raw binary data directly, and must rely instead on surrogate text files.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.25">Historically the proprietary nature of binary files associated with proteomics technologies represented a significant obstacle to efforts aimed at development of integrated, desktop environments.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.26">One solution proposed specifically for mass spectrometry is extraction of native data to a common file format, typically a dialect of XML [8,9].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.27">We [10] and others [11] have challenged the technical merits of this approach.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.28">Given that mass spectrometry manufacturers implicitly carry the burden of maintaining up-to-date libraries for access to their native data, we recently proposed that a common API [10] is a more rational solution for shared access to proprietary mass spectrometry files.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.29">Here we define and implement a minimal API (mzAPI) that provides direct, programmatic interaction with binary raw files and we demonstrate that performance for practical tasks is significantly faster as compared to equivalent operations for access to mzXML files.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.30">We implement mzAPI in Python to maximize accessibility; similarly, mzAPI is exposed to users through multiplierz, a Python-based desktop environment that combines an intuitive interface with a powerful and flexible high-level scripting platform.</sentence>

				</DocumentPart>
				<DocumentPart type="Text">
					<sentence id="S14.36">As described above, direct access to native mass spectrometry data files is a key factor in the assembly of a powerful and flexible framework for proteomics data analysis.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.37">Towards this end, we define a minimal mzAPI as consisting of the following key procedures:</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.38">1. scan(time) › [(mz, intensity)]</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.39">2. scan_list(start_time, stop_time) › [(time, precursor)]</sentence>

					<sentence id="S14.41">4. scan_time_from_scan_name (scan_name) › time</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.42">5. ric(start_time, stop_time, start_mz, stop_mz) › [(time, intensity)]</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.43">The first two procedures in mzAPI return: 1) individual scans in the form of a list of (mz, intensity) pairs, and 2) a catalog of all scan descriptions in the form of a list of (time, precursor) pairs in the experiment.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.44">In addition, the API provides: 3) 'time_range' that returns the earliest and latest acquisition times in the experiment, and 4) 'scan_time_from_scan_name' for translation of manufacturer-specific scan nomenclature to the mzAPI naming convention.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.45">We opted to rely on acquisition time as a common naming convention.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.46">In the case of LC-MS this is equivalent to chromatographic retention time.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.47">Finally, a fifth procedure generates a reconstructed ion chromatogram (RIC) for a given time and mass-to-charge range, returned as a set of (time, intensity) pairs.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.48">While in principle <xcope id="X14.48.2">RICs <cue ref="X14.48.2" type="speculation">can</cue> be generated using the first two calls</xcope>, we <xcope id="X14.48.1"><cue ref="X14.48.1" type="speculation">believe</cue> that ubiquitous use of the RIC operation in proteomics data analysis justifies exposure of RIC extraction as a primitive in the API</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.49">Given that RIC extraction is provided by all manufacturer libraries, this procedure represents an excellent example of efficient re-use of native data system indexing and software.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.50">We <xcope id="X14.50.2"><cue ref="X14.50.2" type="speculation">propose</cue> that a proprietary file format is considered mzAPI compliant when the manufacturer provides a freely available, and preferably redistributable, implementation of the aforementioned 5 core procedures, or an extended version that <xcope id="X14.50.1"><cue ref="X14.50.1" type="speculation">may</cue> evolve from a community-driven standardization effort</xcope></xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.51">For example, ThermoFisher Scientific provides a data access library for .RAW files through the MSFileReader program, freely available for download at: http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=586 or http://blais.dfci.harvard.edu/research/mass-informatics/mzAPI/vendor-libraries/.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.52">Naturally, <xcope id="X14.52.1">additional procedure calls, such as charge state or signal-to-noise values for each isotope cluster in MS or MS/MS scans, <cue ref="X14.52.1" type="speculation">can</cue> be incorporated into the mzAPI framework by essentially subclassing the core mzFile class</xcope>.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.53">As a basic test of file access speed, we compared the time required for random access of scans in an LC-MS acquisition from a ThermoFisher .RAW file using mzAPI (through its Python implementation) versus libraries provided by the manufacturer and included in the native Xcalibur file browser (note that mzXML data was not considered for this comparison since it does not provide access by acquisition time as a primitive in the RAP or RAMP API).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.54">Table 1 demonstrates that, as expected, random file access via mzAPI is slower than that obtained when working directly in the manufacturer's native environment.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.55"><xcope id="X14.55.1">The performance of the common API <cue ref="X14.55.1" type="speculation">could</cue> be further improved by implementation in C++ or C#</xcope>, but we explicitly chose Python to maintain maximum flexibility through user defined scripts (see below).</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.56">Interestingly, one consequence of the common API strategy is that it provides a direct measure of manufacturer data system efficiency, as evidenced by the additional time required for random access to scans in .WIFF versus .RAW files.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.57">Regardless of native file type, the use of a common API eliminates the need for storage and tracking of surrogate files; based on previous reports, this <xcope id="X14.57.2"><cue ref="X14.57.2" type="speculation">can</cue> be particularly problematic for full profile data files, which <xcope id="X14.57.1"><cue ref="X14.57.1" type="speculation">can</cue> grow significantly in size upon conversion to XML</xcope></xcope> [9].</sentence>

					<sentence id="S14.59">Given the multidimensional nature of mass-spectrometry data, extraction based on specific slices through the data space, rather than random file access, is a more relevant performance metric for mass spectrometry files.</sentence>

					<sentence id="S14.61">Consequently we next sought to test the performance of mzAPI for creation of RICs directly from a .RAW file.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.62">As a point of comparison we generated the corresponding mzXML file (using TPP version 4.0) [12] and extracted RICs using both a graphical user interface (GUI) based browser tool (InsilicosViewer version 1.5.1) [3] as well as the Perl-based InSilicoSpectro environment (version 1.3.19) [6] and the R-based XCMS (version 1.12.1), [13] scriptable interface platforms.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.63">Although the latter two are designed to access a number of third-party file formats, none of the GUI- or command-line based tools supports access to specified subsets (in chromatographic time) of the underlying data.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.64">As a result we generated RICs by extraction of a specific mass-to-charge range over the full data file, or in the case of InSilicoSpectro, which had no support for RIC generation, we simply timed the opening of mzXML files.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S14.65">While the mzXML schema includes a scan index that provides for random access to scans at speeds competitive with, or exceeding, proprietary data system (in this case ThermoFisher Xcalibur) [9], Table 1 shows that generation of specific data slices, or in this case RICs, is 5- to 10-fold faster when leveraging the underlying manufacturer's API compared to GUI or command line based access to mzXML (scripts used for all timings included in Additional File 1).</sentence>

					<sentence id="S15.19">For template-based modeling (TBM) and fold recognition methods, <xcope id="X15.19.1">a prediction model <cue ref="X15.19.1" type="speculation">can</cue> be built based on the coordinates of the appropriate template(s)</xcope> [1].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S15.20">These approaches generally involve four steps: 1) a representative protein structure database is searched to identify a template that is structurally similar to the protein target; 2) an alignment between the target and the template is generated that <xcope id="X15.20.1"><cue ref="X15.20.1" type="speculation">should</cue> align equivalent residues together as in the case of a structural alignment</xcope>; 3) a prediction structure of the target is built based on the alignment and the selected template structure, and 4) model quality evaluation.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S15.21">The first two steps significantly affect the quality of the final model prediction in TBM methods.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S15.22">The secondary structure of a protein is often more conserved than the amino acid sequence, and the prediction accuracy of the secondary structure has been achieved ~80% on average.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S15.23">Recently, a number of methods, integrating secondary structures (i.e., α-helix, ß-strand and coil) with primary amino acid sequences, have successfully detected the homologs with remote similarity for automated comparative modeling [2-6] and fold recognition [7-12].</sentence>
					<sentence id="S15.24">These methods often used two separated substitution matrices [9,10,13] to score secondary structures and primary amino acids, respectively, for aligning a residue pair.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S15.25">The separated matrices are unable to reflect the real score because the amino acid type often prefers to a specific secondary structure.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S15.26">Here, we have developed a substitution matrix, called S2A2, which considers the properties of the secondary structures and amino acid types.</sentence>
					<sentence id="S15.27">The S2A2 is a 60 × 60 matrix that considers all <xcope id="X15.27.1"><cue ref="X15.27.1" type="speculation">possible</cue> pair combination of 20 amino acid types and three secondary structure elements</xcope>.</sentence>
